    <h1>Welcome to Gibberfish!</h1>
    <h5>©Copyright 2026</h5>
    <h3>Gibberfish is developed by a group of friends that call themselves the "Gibber Enterprise." Gibberfish is a coding language for people who dont know how to code. (Which lets be honest, is most of you) Learn how to code. But in the fun way. Gibberfish is chaotic and trollful. Gibberfish runs commands based on random letters, so if you type dfjdkjf then you could literally get anything. And I mean ANYTHING. Fun right? But there are some modes that might, well. troll you so much that you will go running to your mommy. The "Troll Mode setting" enables random outcomes that might be to scary or nerve shivering to young lads under the age of 13. If you are not a person who screams at the sight of a dog. Or an adult who blows theirself up by "calling" mcdonalds at 3 am. Then you are not in danger of the age restriction and theirfore you can use it because you are very mature.😏</h3>
